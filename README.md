## ðŸš€ About Me
I've been a Software Developer for 5 years now. My work primarily involves developing backend APIs written in .NET Core.

## ðŸŒ± Currently Exploring
ðŸ”­ My current goal is to develop an assistant based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and various automations to accelerate my workflow. This project aims to leverage cutting-edge technology to streamline processes and increase efficiency in my daily tasks.
ðŸŒ± Recently, I've been focusing on Large Language Models (LLMs), Langchain, vector databases, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
